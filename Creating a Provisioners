 #######################   STEPS   #############################
 
 1. write a code for creating a instance.
 2. Next, we need to do connection for local to remote server for that we need to create a key_pair by using ssh connection on local machine.
 
      resource "aws_key_pair" "developer" {
         key_name = "developer"
         public_key = " "  ( here we need to mention after generation of ssh public key).
         
 3. ssh key-gen  ( Here created a ppk file with the name (developer)).
 4. take that ppk file and add in .tf file under the section of key_pair. next we need to add that public key in under resource section.
    key_name = "developer"
 5. Once EC2 instance created we need to instal some softwares(apache, maven,git etc...) on remote sevrer. to install packeges we need to use remote-exec provisioner.
  üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç  Note :-  whenever we are writing any provisioner we should write a resourse section.
  
 6. First we need to ADD file provisioner under resource section.  
     provisioner "file" {
        source = "root/mycloud/terraform/index.html" ####  ( Just we need to mention our local machine path of that file).
        destination = "tmp/index.html"   #######   ( By default path is tmp).
        
 7. Next, we will write a remote-exec provisioner for install some packages.
       provisioner "remote-exec" {
           inline = [
             "sudo yum install httpd -y",
             "sudo systemctl start httpd",
             "sudo systemctl enable https",
             "cp /tmp.index.html /var/www/html",  ##### ( Here actual path of remote server is /tmp/ from this location to we are copying index.html file to var/www/html)00
             "sudo systemctl restart httpd"
           ]
          }
         
  8. Next, we will write a connection for connect the remote server.
  
            connection {
               host = self.public_ip
               user = "ec2-user"
               type = "ssh"
               private_key = file("./developer") ###### ( Here we are using above key for accessing).
               
             }
     9. $ terraform init
        $ terraform validate
        $ terraform plan
        $ terraform apply
        
     10. Next, we need to login that server through using ssh.
       
          $ ssh -i "developer" ec2-user@<public ip of remote server>.
             it should be login on remote server.
              
             $ sudo -i
             $ cd /tmp/
             $ ls 
                index.html
             $ cd /var/www/html
             $ ls 
                index.html
             $ systemctl status httpd
             
             Then take that public IP copy on google.
